# A Lossless Image Coding Based on LPC

## Arithmetic coding based on LPC project
The basic arithmetic coding programs refer to https://github.com/nayuki/Reference-arithmetic-coding/tree/master/java

### Structure
data: including the images set, the best weight computation .m file, and the weight output

src: the main programs consist of .java files

result: the LPC-ACC encoding and decoding result
